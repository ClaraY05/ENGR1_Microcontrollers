# Day 8 - PROJECT Pinball

The focus for Day 8 is to use all of the information learned this week to develop a project. This will be less guided, as the student is responsible for determining how to accomplish the goals in a given project spec.

## Project Spec
Pinball is a popular arcade game where a player controls paddles and other moving components to get a ball to bounce off of a goal. if the player fails to keep the ball from falling through the paddles it is game over. Make a **simplified version of pinball using an arduino, servo motors, and a photo cell**.

For the program...
- make a button that spins the servo motor so it can knock back items
- wire up your photocell and make arduino detect when the sensor is covered
- if a sensor is covered make it add points
- display these points to serial monitor or processing

CAD a case or create on with cardboard to make the components sit properly.
