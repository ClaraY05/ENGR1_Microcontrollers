# ENGR1_Microcontrollers

## About
This repository was developed to serve as an accompanying repository for **UCLA's Engineering 1 - Microcontroller's course**. All of the curriculumn / content was based off of the curriculumn developed by [Professor Jacob Schmidt](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/jacob-schmidt/), with adjustments and additional reading developed by myself (ENGR1 Microcontrollers Summer 2025 Instructor).

This coursework was developed with a 3 week full-time schedule in mind. Content adapted for the typical 10 week quarter may be missing some information explained in this repository.
