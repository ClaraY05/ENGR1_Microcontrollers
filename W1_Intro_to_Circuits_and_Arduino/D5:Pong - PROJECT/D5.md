# Day 4 - PROJECT Pong

The focus for Day 5 is to use all of the information learned this week to create a project. This will be less guided, as the student is responsible for determining how to accomplish the goals in a given project spec.

## Project Spec
Pong is  a classic 2D video-game that focuses on simulating table tennis virtually. Players each move a paddle that they control with an up and down input to move a ball across the screen,, if the player fails to block the ball from passing the bar, the opposing player gains a point.

- Our project uses **inputs from our arduino to control the pong paddles**, and a **button to trigger the game**

- Our **processing code takes these values** from our Serial print as inputs that control the graphics of our pong game.

- As long as there are two potentiometers for each player and an input to start the game you can **use any combination of inputs you want**
