# Day 1 - Intro to Circuits and Electronics

The focus for Day 1 is **getting comfortable with breadboards and basic circuits** so that when the time comes for microcontrollers, nobody fries their device. As a result there won't be any code documents for references.

## Resistor Networks
- **Current(I in Amperes A)**: movement of positive charges (the motion of electrons is the opposite of current)
    - flows from a point of high electrical potential energy (V) ti a lower point of electrical potential energy
    - if we traverse from a higher (A) to lower (B) point, then I(AB) is positive
    - ![current across a resistor](./images/D1.1.png)
- Amount of current flowing is 
    - proportional to difference in potential difference between 2 points (**Voltage(V in Volts V)**) 
    - inversely proportional to electrical resistance between 2 points (**Resistance(R in Ohms Ω)**)
    - known as **Ohm's Law**: V=IR
- Energy transmitted per second (**Power(P in Watts W)**) P = VI = (I^2)R
- Voltage is only meaningful when comparing two points, so often a reference potential is assigned (set to 0V) when solving for all the relative values
    - this is known as **Ground**
    - ![ground symbol](./images/D1.2.png)
- **Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)**: as current flows and meets at branch points, the sum of current entering the branch point must equal the sum of current exiting the branch point
    - parallel (components with the same start / end nodes) elements have the same voltage across them
    - series (components where one's end node connects w/ the other's start) elements have the same current across them
- **Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: the total voltage rise from sources must be equal to the total voltage drop across components in any closed loop

All of these conventions can be used to complete basic circuit analysis (Finding V,I,R values at different points)

## Circuit Diagrams
- Wires are electrical connections with zero resistance and are drawn as intersecting lines
    - there exists multiple conventions
    - ![circuit wire schematics](./images/D1.4.png)
- constant voltage sources in circuit diagrams provide voltage in a circuit
    - the wider end is the positive side
    - ![schematic with voltage source](./images/D1.5.png)

## Components in the Real World
- Often to prototype designs and experiment with how components behave, breadboards are used to prototype designs
- DMMs / Digital Multimeters are used to measure the difference between two probs (potential difference, resistance, current flowing)
- Resistor values can be printed on the surface as numbers or color bands which give tolerance, power, and resistance
    - ![resistor color bands](./images/D1.6.png)

To gain a better understanding of breadboards and real world components its recommend you experiment with these components, measuring resistance, capacitance etc. as you orient resistors on a breadboard.

## Useful Components / Circuits
- **Thermistor**: temperature dependent resistor, resistance changes with temperature
    - temperature can be derived from resistance using The Steinhart-Hart equation
    - there are multiple variations of equations (top: uses 3 predefined constants, bottom: uses 1 constant and relative temp at 25C)
    - ![Steinhart EQ 1](./images/D1.7.png)
    - ![Steinhart EQ 2](./images/D1.8.png)
- **Voltage Divider**: circuit used to change voltage based on ratio of resistors
    - can be used to create a preferred Vout
    - can be used to determine a variable resistance if Vout is known / measured
    - ![Voltage Divider](./images/D1.9.png)

Imagine how these components can be used in combination to determine temperature at a given time.
